# Hero Rank Challenge

This is a challenge from the DIO Bootcamp Potência Tech iFood - Programação do Zero. 

The challenge consists of creating a variable to store a hero's name and their amount of experience (xp), and then implementing a decision structure to display one of the following messages:

```
- If XP is less than 1,000 = Iron.
- If XP is between 1,001 and 2,000 = Bronze.
- If XP is between 2,001 and 5,000 = Silver.
- If XP is between 6,001 and 7,000 = Gold.
- If XP is between 7,001 and 8,000 = Platinum.
- If XP is between 8,001 and 9,000 = Ascendant.
- If XP is between 9,001 and 10,000 = Immortal.
- If XP is greater than or equal to 10,001 = Radiant.
```
At the end, the following message should be displayed: "The hero `name` is at the level `level`."
